        <h2> About</h2>
        <p> This course will prepare students for many kinds of writing, including reports, resumes, blogs, website
            content, proposal writing and copywriting. In the uneven playing field of our education system, fluency in
            English is particularly varied across different categories of schools. This course aspires to equalize some
            of that discrepancy to give an equal chance to youth from all kinds of educational institutions. This course
            also covers some basics of Language Arts including grammar, vocabulary, parts of speech and common errors in
            their use. Parts of the course focus on enhancing thinking conceptually, improving observation and
            analytical skills, so that learners can produce richer textual content.</p>
